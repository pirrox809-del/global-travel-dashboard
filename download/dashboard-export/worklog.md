# Global Travel Dashboard — Worklog

Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Build a complete "Global Travel Dashboard" — select 1 of 189 countries, get a unified view combining static DB data (overview, culture, food, customs, prefixes, currency, timezone) with live dynamic data (weather, FX, travel advisory, price estimates).

Work Log:
- Designed Prisma schema: `Country` (metadata) + `CountryContent` (LLM-generated overview/culture/rules/safetyBrief) + `Food` + `PointOfInterest` + `TravelPriceEstimate`. Pushed to SQLite.
- Built `src/lib/cache.ts`: in-memory TTL+LRU cache mirroring a Redis client API (get/set/wrap/invalidatePrefix + stats) so production swap is a 1-file change. TTL constants centralised (weather 20m, fx 6h, advisory 12h, country list 24h, country meta 7d).
- Built external API clients (all 100% free, no API key):
  - `rest-countries.ts` → switched to GitHub mirror `mledoze/countries` (restcountries.com is fully deprecated across v3.1 AND v5). 250 countries synced into DB on first boot. Flags resolved via flagcdn.
  - `open-meteo.ts` → current weather + 24h hourly + 7-day forecast. WMO weather-code → emoji/label map.
  - `frankfurter.ts` → updated to `.dev/v1` (old `.app` 301-redirects). ECB reference rates, cached 6h.
  - `travel-advisory.ts` → US State Dept API (unreachable in sandbox → DNS fails) so added graceful fallback.
  - `llm-content.ts` → z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM generates ONE structured JSON blob per country (overview, culture, unwrittenRules, safetyBrief, foods[], pois[], priceEstimate). Persisted permanently in DB → first request ~15-30s, subsequent ~0.04s (750x faster).
- Built `src/lib/aggregate.ts` (the Data Aggregator): Promise.allSettled over DB + weather + fx + advisory in parallel. Each source wrapped so partial failures degrade gracefully. Advisory falls back to LLM `safetyBrief` when US State Dept unreachable (clearly labelled "AI Safety Brief").
- API routes: `/api/countries` (list, auto-syncs on empty DB) + `/api/countries/[code]` (aggregated payload).
- Frontend: TanStack Query + next-themes. Country selector (cmdk, grouped by region). Dashboard with 9 card types (hero, weather, exchange, advisory, overview, culture, unwritten rules, food, POI, price estimates). Skeleton loaders matching layout. Sticky header + sticky footer (min-h-screen flex-col + mt-auto). Warm gradient bg, emerald/amber/rose accents (no indigo/blue).
- Browser-verified golden path: France (cached, instant), Japan (live JPY=185.66), Egypt (fresh generation, "Just curated" banner, EGP gracefully flagged "not on ECB list"). Mobile 390px + desktop 1440px + dark mode all verified. Zero console errors.

Stage Summary:
- 250 countries available in DB (vs 189 requested — covers the vast majority easily).
- All external data sources 100% free, no API keys.
- Two-layer caching: TTL in-memory for dynamic data + permanent DB rows for LLM content. Measured: 33.7s first call → 0.04s second call.
- Graceful degradation proven (EGP not on ECB list, US State Dept unreachable → AI brief fallback).
- Production architecture documented inline in every file. Swap cache→Redis or SQLite→PostgreSQL is a 1-file change each.

Task ID: 2
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Add multilingual support (EN/ES/IT/FR) + answer data-accuracy question.

Work Log:
- Answered accuracy question honestly: weather/FX/metadata are REAL (live APIs); culture/food/POI/prices/safety-brief are AI-curated (clearly labelled in UI).
- Built `src/lib/i18n.ts`: 4-locale dictionary (en/es/it/fr) covering ~90 UI strings + region-name translations + locale-aware date/time formatters. Custom solution (not next-intl routing) because the project constraint is single-route `/`.
- Built `LanguageProvider` context with `useSyncExternalStore` for hydration-safe locale detection (localStorage + browser language), avoiding the setState-in-effect lint rule. Exposes `t()`, `trRegion()`, `fmt` formatters.
- Built `LanguageSwitcher` (Popover + Command) with flag + ISO code, persisted to localStorage.
- Added `contentLanguage` field to `CountryContent` Prisma schema. The aggregator now regenerates LLM content when the cached language differs from the requested locale — one regeneration per language switch per country, then cached again.
- Updated LLM prompt to instruct the model to write ALL human-readable text in the target language (passed as native name: "Italian", "Spanish", etc.).
- Updated API route `/api/countries/[code]?lang=XX` to read the locale; updated `useCountry` hook to send `?lang=` + include locale in the query key (so language switches trigger refetch).
- Rewrote all 10 UI components to use `useT()`/`useLanguage()`: header, footer, selector, empty state, hero, weather/exchange/advisory/overview/culture/food/poi/price cards, source badges.
- Browser-verified: switched EN→IT (UI translated instantly, France content regenerated in Italian ~15s: "La Francia: arte, storia e gastronomia…", tagline/safety/overview/food all Italian), EN→ES (regenerated in Spanish ~15s). Zero console errors. Mobile + desktop verified.

Stage Summary:
- 4 languages fully working: English, Español, Italiano, Français.
- UI chrome translates instantly (no API call). LLM content regenerates on language switch (~15s one-time per country per language, then cached in DB).
- Country names stay in English (proper nouns, universally recognizable). Region headings localized (Europa, Afrique, África…).
- Dates/times locale-aware (lun 24, lun. 24, Mon 24).
- `contentLanguage` tracked per country so we know which language is cached and regenerate only when needed.

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Add an elegant intro/landing home screen as the dashboard's front door.

Work Log:
- Added ~16 intro i18n strings (badge, title1, title2, subtitle, body, CTA, hint, 4 feature title/desc pairs) to all 4 locales (en/es/it/fr) in src/lib/i18n.ts.
- Created `src/components/intro-screen.tsx`: full-screen editorial hero with (a) rotating compass medallion with glow, (b) badge, (c) two-line gradient title, (d) poetic subtitle, (e) 4 frosted-glass feature pills (Live Weather / Exchange Rates / Travel Advisories / AI-Curated), (f) prominent gradient CTA "Begin exploration", (g) "No sign-up · No API keys · 100% free" hint. Floating language + theme controls top-right. Staggered cascade entrance via framer-motion (badge → title → subtitle → features → CTA → hint).
- Updated `src/components/dashboard-app.tsx`: added `entered` state (lazy init from sessionStorage + deep-link detection — no setState-in-effect). Wrapped content in `<AnimatePresence mode="wait">` so intro fades out (0.4s) and dashboard fades in (0.5s) smoothly. NeuralNoise backdrop stays mounted at the root so the shader doesn't restart during the transition.
- Logic: first visit (no `?c=`, no sessionStorage flag) → intro. Click CTA → sessionStorage set + dashboard revealed. Deep-link `?c=FR` → skip intro entirely. New session → intro shows again.
- Browser-verified: intro loads with all content (badge, title, subtitle, 4 features, CTA, hint). Click "Begin exploration" → smooth fade to dashboard (header + selector + empty state). Language switch on intro translates instantly (IT: "Dashboard Viaggi Globale", "Inizia a esplorare"). Deep-link `?c=FR` bypasses intro. Mobile 390px + desktop 1440px verified. Zero console errors.

Stage Summary:
- Elegant editorial intro as the dashboard's front door, matching the amber/rose glass aesthetic.
- 4-language support on the intro itself (user can localise before entering).
- sessionStorage-based gate: shows once per session, deep-links bypass.
- Smooth AnimatePresence transition intro→dashboard, no shader flicker.
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Task: Integrate HeroFuturistic 3D WebGPU animation as the intro's visual centerpiece.

Work Log:
- Installed three@0.185, @react-three/fiber@9, @react-three/drei@10. Verified both external textures (postimg.cc color + depth maps) are reachable (HTTP 200).
- Created `src/components/ui/hero-futuristic.tsx` — adapted the provided component:
  - Props: `titleWords`, `subtitle`, `ctaLabel`, `onEnter` (replaces hardcoded "Build Your Dreams" text).
  - Kept the full 3D pipeline: WebGPU renderer + TSL displacement-mapped plane + dot-grid mask + red scan-line post-processing + bloom.
  - Graceful fallback: `CanvasBoundary` error boundary + `hasWebGPU()` check → if WebGPU unsupported or canvas throws, the 3D layer is silently dropped and the text overlay + CTA still render on the NeuralNoise backdrop.
  - Fixed React 19 lint compliance: TSL uniforms moved to MODULE SCOPE (avoids react-hooks/immutability + react-hooks/refs rules that flag mutating `.value` on hook-derived values); `visible` derived from `useTexture` suspension (no useState/effect); `webgpuOk` + `delays` via lazy useState (no setState-in-effect); deprecated `PostProcessing`→`RenderPipeline` and `renderAsync()`→`render()` with runtime fallback.
- Added CSS animations to globals.css: `.fade-in` (glitch-in: translateY + skewX + blur), `.fade-in-subtitle` (soft fade-up), `.explore-btn` (fixed pill button with delayed fade-in, amber glow on hover, arrow bounce), all respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Rewrote `src/components/intro-screen.tsx` to use `HeroFuturistic` as the full-screen visual layer, with language/theme toggles floating top-right (z-80). Title = `intro.title1 + intro.title2` split into words for the staggered glitch animation.
- Browser-verified: intro loads with 3D canvas (WebGL2 fallback in headless Chromium — WebGPU detected but falls back gracefully), text animates word-by-word ("GLOBAL TRAVEL DASHBOARD" → "EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH, IN A SINGLE GLANCE."), "Begin exploration" CTA fades in at 2.2s. Click CTA → smooth fade transition to dashboard. Italian switch works ("DASHBOARD VIAGGI GLOBALE", "Inizia a esplorare"). Mobile 390px verified. Zero real errors (only three.js deprecation warnings from Clock/PostProcessing internals).

Stage Summary:
- Sci-fi 3D hero with displacement-mapped surface + animated red scan-line + bloom as the intro's visual centerpiece.
- Staggered glitch-in text animation (per-word fade + skew + blur).
- "Begin exploration" CTA pill with amber glow hover, wired to reveal dashboard.
- Full graceful degradation: WebGPU unsupported → WebGL2 fallback → error boundary → text-only on NeuralNoise. Text + CTA always functional.
- 4-language support on the intro text (title, subtitle, CTA all localized).
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion.
